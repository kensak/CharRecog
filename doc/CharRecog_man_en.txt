NAME
    CharRecog - a character recognition engine using the neural network

SYNOPSIS
    CharRecog {options} <command> [<data-dir> [<data-dir2>]]

DESCRIPTION
    CharRecog is a character recognition engine using the neural network.

    Using CharRecog, you can train a wide range of network model by a set of image files,
    initialize weights by autoencoding, calculate recognition (or error) rate from a set of images,
    or make image files out of layers' weight data.
    
    CharRecog supports following commands.

    TRAIN   Train the network for the classification task, using the training image files
            in <data-dir>.
            The class of an image is identified by the first letter in the file name.
            -p option specifies the name of the network parameter file.
            If the parameter file already exists, CharRecog reads the parameters from it and
            starts training further using the training files.
            If the parameter file does not exist, CharRecog will construct a network model
            from -L option string, and starts training from scratch.
    TEST    Predict the class of the images in <data-dir>.
            With -u option, CharRecog just predicts the class and print it for each image.
            Without -u option, the first letter in the image file name will be considered
            as the true class, and the recognition rate of the whole set of images will be
            calculated (-v option prints the predicted class for each image).
    AE      Train by autoencoding. Otherwise this command is just like TRAIN.
    WIMAGE  Output the weights of the layers as images.
                
    Log messages willbe written into log/log.txt.

EXAMPLES

    1. Standard Perceptron

    CharRecog -b -h 28 -w 28 -L P,784,500,0.2_P,500,500_P,500,10_S,10 -i 200 -E 10 -m RPROP (‘±‚­)
        TRAIN train_data test_data
    
    The images have black backgrounds, and of size 28x28.
    It iterates for 200 times, and the recognition rate of both the training and test set
    will be calculated every 10 iterations.
    The model has the following layes:
     
        Tanh perceptron layer : 784 -> 500, dropout ratio = 0.200000
        Tanh perceptron layer : 500 -> 500
        Tanh perceptron layer : 500 -> 10
        Softmax layer : 10 -> 10
    
    2. Maxout + Dropout
